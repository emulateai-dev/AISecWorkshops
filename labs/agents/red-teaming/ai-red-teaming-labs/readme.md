# 🔴 AI Red Teaming Playground Labs – Quick Start

## 1. Install

You already ran:

```bash
./labs/AISecWorkshops/labs/setup/scripts/tools/install-ai-red-teaming-playground-labs.sh
```

This cloned the repo into:

```
/home/dtx/labs/agents/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
```

and wrote `.env` with default port **15000**.

---

## 2. Start the Playground

From the repo directory:

```bash
cd /home/dtx/labs/agents/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
PORT=15000 ./start.sh
```

✅ This brings up multiple **Docker containers** that host the playground challenges.

---

## 3. Access the Playground

Open in browser:

Similar to the following link

👉 [http://LAB_IP:15000/login?auth=dummy7d27427c2ae70d33dd487ec620ce5772](http://LAB_IP:15000/login?auth=dummy7d27427c2ae70d33dd487ec620ce5772)

You’ll land on the login page, already authenticated by the token in the URL.

---

## 4. Explore Challenges

Once inside, you’ll find **different adversarial ML and AI security challenges**.
Examples include:

* **Prompt Injection**
* **Jailbreaks**
* **Data Exfiltration**
* **Model Evasion**
* **Adversarial Examples**

Each challenge is self-contained and provides **instructions + a target model/app** to attack.

---

## 5. Stop the Playground

When done, stop containers with:

```bash
cd /home/dtx/labs/agents/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
./stop.sh
```
